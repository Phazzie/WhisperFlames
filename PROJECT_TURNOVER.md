# SDD Project Turnover - Context for New Chat Session

**Project:** Seam-Driven Development (SDD) TypeScript MCP Server Proof-of-Concept  
**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 6B.1 - Building Template Engine (SDD-Compliant Approach)  
**Status:** Active Development - 91 of 160+ checklist items completed (57%)

---

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **What is SDD (Seam-Driven Development)?**
Seam-Driven Development is a software methodology that enforces:
1. **Seam-First Development:** Identify all system boundaries (APIs, databases, file I/O, external services) before implementation
2. **Contract-Driven Workflow:** Define explicit YAML contracts for every seam before writing code
3. **Generation-Over-Editing:** Auto-generate code stubs from contracts rather than manual implementation
4. **Immutable Contracts:** Once created, contracts are versioned (v1→v2) but never edited

### **What We're Building**
A TypeScript MCP server with 5 endpoints demonstrating complete SDD workflow:
- `POST /requirements` ✅ **COMPLETE** - Accept requirements, cache to filesystem
- `POST /seams` 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - LLM-powered seam detection from requirements  
- `POST /contracts` 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Generate YAML contracts from detected seams
- `POST /validate` 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Validate contracts against schema and examples
- `POST /generate` 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Generate TypeScript stubs from validated contracts

## 🚧 **CURRENT STATE & IMMEDIATE CONTEXT**

### **Where We Are Now**
- **Phase 6B.1:** Building template engine for code generation
- **Last Action:** Discovered and corrected SDD violation (created template engine without consulting CodeGenerationSeam contract)
- **Current Need:** Generate TypeScript stub FROM CodeGenerationSeam.contract.v1.yml, then implement according to contract
- **Next Steps:** Complete Phase 6B (stub generation) then Phase 6B.3 (endpoint implementation)

### **Critical SDD Compliance Issues Discovered**
⚠️ **Manual enforcement doesn't scale** - requires constant vigilance, high cognitive overhead
⚠️ **Easy to violate contract-driven workflow** - natural developer instinct to code first
⚠️ **Tooling needs to make SDD the path of least resistance** - not fighting against developer habits

### **Key Files to Understand**
1. **`PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md`** - Complete project tracking (160+ items, 9 phases)
2. **`contracts/*.yml`** - 5 complete SDD contracts defining all seam boundaries
3. **`LESSONS_LEARNED.md`** - Critical insights about manual vs. automated enforcement
4. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - SDD guardrails and methodology enforcement
5. **`src/server.ts`** - Working Express server with 1 complete endpoint

---

## 🎯 **DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**

### **SDD Core Principles (ENFORCE ALWAYS)**
1. **NO CODE UNTIL CONTRACTS EXIST** - Check contracts/ directory first
2. **GENERATE FROM CONTRACTS, DON'T CREATE ARBITRARY CODE** - Use existing contract specifications
3. **src/generated/ IS READ-ONLY** - Manual edits require `Manual-Patch:` trailer
4. **contracts/ IS IMMUTABLE** - Never edit existing contracts, create new versions

### **Before Any Implementation:**
```bash
# ALWAYS run first:
npm run sdd:safe                    # Verify SDD compliance
node scripts/sddCheck.js [feature]  # Check specific feature contracts
npm run sdd:validate                # Validate all contracts

# Then check:
1. What contracts govern this feature?
2. Do stubs need to be generated from contracts first?  
3. What checklist phase are we in?
4. Are we following contract-driven workflow?
```

### **Current SDD Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Husky pre-commit hooks** prevent contract modification
- ✅ **Validation scripts** check YAML syntax and examples
- ✅ **VS Code tasks** automate SDD workflow
- ✅ **NPM scripts** provide SDD automation
- ⚠️ **Manual enforcement** - identified as major limitation

## 🔍 **SPECIFIC CURRENT TASK**

### **Phase 6B.1: Build Template Engine (SDD-Compliant)**
**CRITICAL:** Must follow contract-driven approach, not arbitrary implementation

**Immediate Steps:**
1. **Read CodeGenerationSeam.contract.v1.yml** - understand required interface
2. **Generate TypeScript stub** from contract using existing templates
3. **Implement business logic** according to contract specifications
4. **Test using contract examples** - validate compliance

**Contract Specifications (CodeGenerationSeam):**
- **Input:** `{operation, contract, templateType, options}`
- **Operations:** `["generate_stub", "generate_blueprint", "generate_test", "generate_all", "validate_template", "preview"]`
- **Must follow existing contract interface** - don't create arbitrary methods

---

## 🛠 **TECHNICAL SETUP**

### **Dependencies Installed**
- Express 4.18.2, TypeScript 5.0, Node.js with ESM modules
- Mustache templating, YAML parsing, Husky git hooks
- Comprehensive validation and automation scripts

### **Development Commands**
```bash
npm run dev           # Start development server
npm run sdd:validate  # Validate all contracts
npm run sdd:safe      # Full SDD compliance check
npm start             # Production server (after build)
```

### **Project Structure Compliance**
- **`src/services/`** - Business logic (editable)
- **`src/generated/`** - Auto-generated code (READ-ONLY)
- **`contracts/`** - YAML contracts (IMMUTABLE)
- **`templates/`** - Mustache templates for generation

---

## 📋 **CHECKLIST STATUS**

**Completed Phases:** 0-6A (Setup through contract creation)  
**Current Phase:** 6B.1 (Template engine - in progress)  
**Remaining:** 6B.2-6B.4 (Stub generation and endpoint implementation), Phases 7-9 (Testing, deployment, validation)

**Key Remaining Tasks:**
- Complete template engine following CodeGenerationSeam contract
- Generate TypeScript stubs for all 5 seams
- Implement remaining 4 endpoints using generated stubs
- End-to-end workflow validation

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **For This Proof-of-Concept**
- All 5 endpoints working with complete SDD workflow
- All generated code compiles and follows contracts
- Demonstrate contract-driven development benefits
- Document lessons learned for SDD 2.0 design

### **Key Insights to Validate**
- SDD concepts work (contracts, seams, generation)
- Manual enforcement is impractical for real-world use
- Automated tooling needed for adoption
- Developer experience must be friction-free

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

1. **ALWAYS check existing contracts before implementation**
2. **Generate stubs FROM contracts, don't create arbitrary code**
3. **Follow the checklist phases in order**
4. **Document violations and lessons learned**
5. **Focus on completing proof-of-concept with simplified enforcement**

This project is both implementing SDD AND discovering how to make SDD practical. The methodology itself is evolving based on real development experience.
